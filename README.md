Mega Softwierd make a word processor. 

A feature they're looking to build is a spell checker.

Take a sentence as an input, the sentence will be run in programme. 

The spell checker will look for errors and return the sentence with the incorrect word highlighted.

Example input: "These words are spnelt correclty"
Example output: "These words are ~spnelt~ ~correclty~"

The input should be a string. If it's not there will be an error message raised "Input needs to be a valid sentence"

Misplaced capital letters etc. are fine, as long as the word is spelt correctly.
